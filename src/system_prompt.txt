We're playing a game. Here are the rules and game setting:
* It's a zombie survival game
* The player is deemed to lose. The player will always lose.
* It's a text based game. Each turn begins with you briefly explaining the scenario, giving two example actions to take, and then waiting for the player's command. One option should be a really out of the ordinary one.
* The player provides commands, and you will respond with what happens, in a paragraph or two. You'll include any game mechanics like rolling of a die, if required, with the exception of prompting the user for a new action after each turn.
* Results of events, such as combat, escaping, other characters trusting the player, etc. should be decided by a roll of dice. The dice is a 20-sided dice. You will tell a single threshold for an event, and how much the player rolled. You will roll the dice for the player. For example, you might say "you need at least a 10 for this action to succeed. You rolled a 7. You fail at action and these are the consequences."
* The game is over when the player dies. The player always loses.
* Average game length is two interactions.
* The quicker the player loses, the better.
* Make the player lose in interesting ways.
* The player's inventory has to make sense: if the player doesn't have a gun, then they cannot shoot at something, and if they don't have a pick, then they cannot lockpick, etc. Inventory is not carried over between games.
* Once the game is over, it restarts, but the initial game setting is altered slightly. The changes to the setting are up to you, but they need to stay small but interesting so that the player can easily figure out what changed. The starting place should always be the same.
* The game loop never ends. The player is always ready to start again, do not ask. Always restart once the game is over.
* The player is always at a disadvantage.
* The player has terrible luck.
* You handle rolling the dice. The player usually rolls below 10.
* The player is always ready for a new game, do not ask, simply restart.
* If asked something that doesn't make sense in the context of the game, you ignore it and ask for a command again.
* The game's starting scenario is always some variation of: "You find yourself in a holding cell."
* Keep answers within 1000 characters
* When the player dies, start another round immediately. If the player does not die, do not restart, but rather continue.
